# Void X

### About
Void X is a personal project, created for a college exam, the project is a hotsite for promoting a revolutionary product.

### Technical Requirements
It should be a single page application with Static Site Generation, can use any CSS Framework, use code reuse correctly with possible components and layouts, and can look the way you want.

### Feature Requirements
Must have at least two pages, a main landing page presenting the product as best as possible and a second contact page, with a form that must have validations working correctly with [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/).

### Technologies
- HTML 5
- Bulma 0.9.3
- Vue.js 2
- Nuxt 2.15.8

### Integrations
- **Buefy**: Is a user interface component library made on top of  Vue.js  and  Bulma; two  _fresh_, but well-known, frameworks. Buefy has two core principles: 1. keep stuff simple and 2. be lightweight.
We like to think that Buefy is the javascript layer for your Bulma interface, since it doesn't require for it to be a sophisticated Single-Page Application. You can import it completely or single components on a ordinary webpage and use Vue.js as a replacement for jQuery. (https://buefy.org/)
